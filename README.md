redesigning a non-profit website

#Premise
I volunteered for PATCH Hawaii awhile ago. I remember their website to be in need of a redesign. I'm putting my full stack skills to practice by giving it a face-lift. Biggest obstacle is their overwhelming amount of navigation components. I'm addressing that issue with the guidelines [here.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/navigation-mega-sites/)

#Technologies to be used

* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* AngularJS
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* GIMP

#Rapid Prototype Development Stages

1. Build static site
* figure out layout
* ensure user flow makes sense

2. Design the data model, create the database
* define datamodel that reflects requirements of the app
* create database to work with the model

3. Build Data API
* create REST API for app to interat with database

4. Hook database into app
* get app to talk to API

5. Augment the app
* finishing touches and UX
