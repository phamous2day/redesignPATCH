redesigning a non-profit website

#Premise
I volunteered for PATCH Hawaii awhile ago. I remember their website to be in need of a redesign. I'm putting my full stack skills to practice by giving it a face-lift. Biggest obstacle is their overwhelming amount of navigation components. I'm addressing that issue with the guidelines [here.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/navigation-mega-sites/)

#Technologies to be used
*HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
